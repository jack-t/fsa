See the section "What am I looking at?" to navigate to the relevant files in these folders.

I initially downloaded the files in these folders with wget, a common Linux utility which create copies of webpages. I then edited the appropriate pages' HTML to implement the changes I specify in the document which accompanies the files in this directory.
